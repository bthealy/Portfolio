The code "stock_market_fuzzy.m" is ready to run when started, just make
sure that "equiv_price.fis" and "action_fuzzy.fis" are in the same
directory.

It has a default of 365 days set for the simulation. To change this,
set the variable "days" to the length you want.

It outputs a graph of the day by day values of "my money". It also 
outputs the value for "my money" and how many stocks you own at the 
end of the simulation.
