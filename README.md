# Autonomous Vehicle
This project was part of an undergraduate introduction to robotics course.

The goal for students was to create a robot that travels straight a certain distance, then navigate boundaries using magnetometer headings.

Controls   - Arduino microcontroller <br />
Steering   - Parallel steering mechanism with servo motor actuator controlled by PID <br />
Propulsion - Pneumatic cylinder and solenoid valve push robot forward <br />
Direction tracking - Magnetometer heading returns orientation similar to compass <br />
Distance tracking  - Reed switch tracked number of wheel rotations <br />
