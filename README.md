# Autonomous Vehicle
This project was part of an undergraduate introduction to robotics course.

The goal for students was to create a robot that travels straight a certain distance, then navigate boundaries using magnetometer headings.

Controls - Arduino microcontroller <br /><br /><br />

Steering - Parallel steering mechanism with servo motor actuator controlled by PID <br /><br /><br />

Propulsion - Pneumatic cylinder and solenoid valve push robot forward <br /><br /><br />

Direction Tracking - Magnetometer heading returns orientation similar to compass <br /><br /><br />

Distance tracking - Reed switch tracked number of wheel rotations
