# Autonomous Vehicle
This project was part of an undergraduate introduction to robotics course.

The goal for students was to create a robot that travels straight a certain distance, then navigate boundaries using magnetometer headings.

Controls   - Arduino microcontroller 
Steering   - Parallel steering mechanism controlled by servo motor 
Propulsion - Pneumatic cylinder and solenoid valve push robot forward
Direction tracking - Magnetometer heading returns orientation similar to compass
Distance tracking  - Reed switch tracked number of wheel rotations
