# Hand-held Robotic Arm
This arm is designed to extend the user's reach. The intent is to assist individuals who have difficulty handling objects on tall shelves or behind obstacles (such as something under or behind a couch). 

A sonar sensor is placed on the arm's gripper, with the distance from the gripper to objects displayed on the arm's handle; allowing for the user to navigate the arm in blind spots. The actuators used are servo motors, controlled by an arduino micro-controller.

Please keep in mind that this project was created in approximately a month for the final project of an upper-division robotics course, so there wasn't much time to aesthetically clean up the prototype.
